# Dimensionality Reduction and Visualization Using Evolutionary Algorithms and Neural Networks

These notebooks contain experiments that are described in my Master thesis "[Evolutionary Algorithms for Data Transformation](https://github.com/svecon/thesis-distance-metric-learning)".

### Structure

The experiments are split into several jupyter notebooks:
- [01]: the datasets used in the paper can be downloaded here, but they are also available in the *datasets* folder
- [02]: improving **success rate of kNN classification experiment**
- [03]: extracting results and plotting graphs from the [02] experiment
- [04]: **dimensionality reduction experiment**
- [05]: generalization of the evolution experiment
- [06]: **measuring learning times** on datasets from [01] experiment
- [07]: measuring run times on continuously increasing dimensions experiment

The raw results from the experiments are saved in *results* folder. The resulting graphs are in the *graphs* folder.
